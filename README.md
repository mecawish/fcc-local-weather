freeCodeCamp's "Show the Local Weather"

A page that will get your location thru geolocation and display your city and country from https://ipinfo.io/. The current local weather is fetched from the Dark Sky API. Used jQuery and weather-icons. This is a project I did years back on codepen https://codepen.io/mecawish/full/gWQeaz which is now included in freeCodeCamp's Take Home Projects.
